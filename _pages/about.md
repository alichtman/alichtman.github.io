Hey! My name is Aaron.

I graduated from UIUC with a degree in CS + Linguistics.

I've been a software / security engineer at Facebook since Sept 2020.

I've contributed a bunch of open-source software, command line tooling, etc that you can check out on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alichtman).

## Website Design

I borrowed a lot of ideas from [Fabien Sanglard's website](https://fabiensanglard.net/), which is maybe the best-designed minimal static blog I've ever seen. Seriously, it's gorgeous.
