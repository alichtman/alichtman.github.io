Hey! My name is Aaron.

I graduated from UIUC with a degree in CS + Linguistics.

I've been a software / security engineer at Facebook since Sept 2020.

I've contributed a bunch of open-source software, command line tooling, etc that you can check out on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alichtman).

## I want to subscribe!

You can subscribe to my blog using the RSS feed [here](https://alichtman.com/feed.xml). I use [`newsboat`](https://newsboat.org/) on the command line, and [`Feedly`](https://feedly.com) for a non-CLI option.

## Website Design

I borrowed a lot of ideas from [Fabien Sanglard's website](https://fabiensanglard.net/). I am pretty sure it's the best-designed minimal static blog I've ever seen.

Seriously, it's **gorgeous**.
