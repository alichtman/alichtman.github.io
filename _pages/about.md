Hey! My name is Aaron. I'm a senior at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. I study CS + Linguistics with a focus on computer security. Most of my projects have a strong security focus to them, but I don't do exclusively security work. The grand majority of the code I've written is open-sourced, and you can check it out on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alichtman)! At the end of the day, it makes me happy to build cool things.

Last summer, I interned on the iOS core team at Wayfair. I'm excited to be heading out to San Francisco this summer to work on Facebook's Authentication service!

Feel free to reach out! Two good ways to contact me are:
