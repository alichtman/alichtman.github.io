Hey! My name is Aaron. I'm graduated from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign with a degree in CS + Linguistics. I've been a software / security engineer at Facebook since Sept 2020. Before that, I was very passionate about open-source work, and you can check it out on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alichtman)!

Feel free to reach out!
