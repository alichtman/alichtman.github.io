Hey! My name is Aaron. I'm a senior at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. I study CS + Linguistics with a focus on computer security. The grand majority of the code I've written is open-source, and you can check it out on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alichtman)!

Last summer, I lived in San Francisco, working on Facebook's Authentication service. I've accepted a full time offer to do security engineering at Facebook, starting in late 2020. In the mean time, I'm spending a semester hiking around Switzerland and exploring Europe.

Feel free to reach out! Five good ways to contact me are:
