Freeze dried meals aren't very difficult to make. It's difficult to find ones that you _enjoy_ eating. But making them is easy: the instructions are right on the side of the bag. You boil some water in a JetBoil or MSR Windburner and then pour it in the bag, mix and wait. There's a recommended amount of water to use for each meal. I've tried a bunch of them, and I think a lot of the suggested ratios are off.

Here are the amounts of water I use (for the meals I like):

+ [Mountain House Pad Thai with Chicken](https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-House-Backpacking-Emergency-Gluten-Free/dp/B084NW22VN?th=1)
    - I follow the official recommendation: 1 and 1/3 cup
+ [Trailtopia Blueberry Oatmeal](https://www.rei.com/product/188956/trailtopia-blueberry-oatmeal-1-serving)
    - The suggested ratio is insane. Use like 2/3 cup of water.
+ [Peak Refuel Chicken Teriyaki Rice](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Refuel-Chicken-Teriyaki-Backpacking/dp/B07BQYXWX1?th=1)
    + Suggested ratio works

_more to come..._
